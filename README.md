# AI Attitude Psychotherapy - SDT Analysis

Predicting AI Acceptance in Mental Health Interventions through Self-Determination Theory: A Cross-Cultural Analysis between China and the United States

## Project Structure

This project is organized into 5 separate notebooks:

1. **01_EDA_Data_Exploration.ipynb** - Exploratory Data Analysis and feature exploration related to hypotheses
2. **02_Hypothesis_1_Main_Effect.ipynb** - Tests H1: SDT predicts AI Acceptance
3. **03_Hypothesis_2_Attitudinal_Moderation.ipynb** - Tests H2: AI Attitudes moderate SDT → AI Acceptance
4. **04_Hypothesis_3_Cross_Cultural_Moderation.ipynb** - Tests H3: Cross-cultural moderation (China vs US)
5. **05_Hypothesis_4_Mediation.ipynb** - Tests H4: Epistemic Trust mediates SDT → AI Acceptance

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run notebooks in order:
   - Start with `01_EDA_Data_Exploration.ipynb` to prepare and explore the data
   - Then run hypothesis testing notebooks (02-05) in any order

## Data

Data files are stored in the `data/` directory:
- `data/china/` - Chinese datasets (CN_all.csv, CN_client.csv, CN_therapist.csv)
- `data/usa/` - US dataset (USA_all.csv)
- `data/processed/` - Processed/combined data (generated by EDA notebook)

**Note**: Data files are excluded from git via `.gitignore` for privacy.

## Utilities

- `data_utils.py` - Contains functions for loading and processing data (used by all notebooks)

## Research Hypotheses

1. **H1**: Main Effect - SDT predicts AI Acceptance
2. **H2**: Attitudinal Moderation - AI attitudes moderate SDT → AI Acceptance relationship
3. **H3**: Cross-Cultural Moderation - Effects stronger in China vs US
4. **H4**: Mediation by Epistemic Trust - Epistemic Trust mediates SDT → AI Acceptance

## Key Variables

- **TENS_Life_mean**: Self-Determination Theory (Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness)
- **UTAUT_AI_mean**: AI Acceptance (Technology Acceptance)
- **GAAIS_mean**: General AI Attitudes (Moderator)
- **ET_mean**: Epistemic Trust (Mediator)
- **country_code**: Culture (0=USA, 1=China)
- **role**: User role (0=Client, 1=Therapist)

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for full list of required Python packages.
