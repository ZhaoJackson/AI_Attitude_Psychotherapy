# AI Attitude Psychotherapy - SDT Analysis

Predicting AI Acceptance in Mental Health Interventions through Self-Determination Theory: A Cross-Cultural Analysis between China and the United States

## Project Structure

- **Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb** – Comprehensive EDA, reliability checks, and hypothesis exploration built on top of the processing pipeline.
- **data_processing.py** – Reusable processing pipeline (loading, scoring, harmonisation, summaries, and exports).

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run notebooks in order:
   - Start with `01_EDA_Data_Exploration.ipynb` to prepare and explore the data
   - Then run hypothesis testing notebooks (02-05) in any order

## Data

Data files are stored in the `data/` directory:
- `data/china/` - Chinese datasets (CN_all.csv, CN_client.csv, CN_therapist.csv)
- `data/usa/` - US dataset (USA_all.csv)
- `data/processed/` - Processed datasets and summary tables generated by the pipeline (`combined_dataset.csv`, `summary_*`).

**Note**: Data files are excluded from git via `.gitignore` for privacy.

## Utilities

- `data_processing.py` - Comprehensive processing pipeline used across notebooks and scripts.

## Research Hypotheses

1. **H1**: Main Effect - SDT predicts AI Acceptance
2. **H2**: Attitudinal Moderation - AI attitudes moderate SDT → AI Acceptance relationship
3. **H3**: Cross-Cultural Moderation - Effects stronger in China vs US
4. **H4**: Mediation by Epistemic Trust - Epistemic Trust mediates SDT → AI Acceptance

## Key Variables

- **TENS_Life_mean**: Self-Determination Theory (Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness)
- **UTAUT_AI_mean**: AI Acceptance (Technology Acceptance)
- **GAAIS_mean**: General AI Attitudes (Moderator)
- **ET_mean**: Epistemic Trust (Mediator)
- **country_code**: Culture (0=USA, 1=China)
- **role_label / role**: User role (therapist, client, community, unspecified)

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for full list of required Python packages.
